    <h2>Delicious and easy to make Chicken Satay</h2>
    
    <p>I made this dish last night and couldn't be more pleased. The marinade was only a handful of ingredients, and the skewers only needed a couple of minutes on the grill.</p>
    
    <p>While the chicken was marinating, I went ahead and made a simple spaghetti with peanut sauce and a fresh cucumber salad. All told, this recipe was only about 20 minutes of cooking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Chicken Breasts, Thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Honey</li>
            <li>2 Cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients to marinade for 1 hour or up to over night</li>
        <li>Add chicken to skewers, folding over so that the strips stay on</li>
        <li>Grill on medium high heat, turning skewers every 3-4 minutes</li>
    </ol>
